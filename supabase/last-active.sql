-- profiles.last_active_at — a maintained "when did this player last do anything"
-- stamp, for the „Biuro" list in the side rail.
--
-- WHY A COLUMN AND NOT THE RPC: the rail first shipped reading
-- player_activity_stats(), which UNIONs ~25 event tables, groups them and does a
-- gaps-and-islands streak pass, all to hand the rail one timestamp per player.
-- That is the right shape for the Statystyki card (which wants the streaks and
-- the per-area counts) and the wrong shape for a list that is on screen on every
-- tab: it forced a 5-minute refresh floor, so the column everyone reads was
-- usually stale. Stamping on write turns it into `select id,nick,last_active_at
-- from profiles` — one indexed read of eleven rows.
--
-- player_activity_stats() is NOT replaced or changed; it still owns the
-- Statystyki tab, and this file's backfill seeds itself from it.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Re-run it after adding a new event table (add the
-- table to the list below), and after any file that recreates one of the listed
-- tables from scratch — a DROP TABLE takes its trigger with it. Nothing else in
-- the schema depends on this file, and dropping the triggers only makes the
-- stamp stop advancing.

ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_active_at timestamptz;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.profiles.last_active_at IS
  'Newest event timestamp across the tables listed in supabase/last-active.sql, maintained by trg_touch_last_active. Advisory: a skipped stamp (see the SKIP LOCKED note) is not an error.';

-- ── The trigger ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- One generic function for every table; the timestamp COLUMN NAME is the
-- trigger argument (seasonal scores use submitted_at, canvas_paint_log uses
-- painted_at, everything else created_at), read out of to_jsonb(NEW) so there is
-- one function instead of twenty-eight near-identical ones to keep in sync.
--
-- ⚠️ THE `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT, not an
-- optimisation. This fires inside other people's transactions — every casino
-- spin, every trade, every coin ledger row — and several of those already hold
-- locks on more than one profiles row (a marketplace sale locks buyer AND
-- seller). An unconditional UPDATE here would add a second, differently-ordered
-- profiles lock to those transactions, which is exactly the shape that made the
-- farm award cron deadlock against the land-tax cron (see
-- farm-seasonal-award-reliability.sql). SKIP LOCKED cannot wait, so it cannot
-- deadlock: a row another transaction holds is simply left alone, and that
-- transaction is itself activity that will stamp it a moment later. Rows locked
-- by the CALLING transaction are not skipped, so the common case — an RPC that
-- did `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the player's own profile before inserting — still
-- stamps normally.
--
-- The EXCEPTION block costs a subtransaction per insert. That is deliberate: a
-- cosmetic activity stamp must never be the reason a payout rolls back.
