-- „Papier, Kamień, Biuro G6" (rps) seasonal game support for Rynek Proroctw G6.
--
-- A remake of ICQ's „RPS Online": a 7×6 board, 14 pieces a side — 12 hidden
-- ✊/✋/✌️ fighters, a 🚩 flag and a 🕳️ trap. Fights reveal both pieces and
-- rock-paper-scissors decides; a tie makes both pick again; step on the flag
-- to win. Always played against the server's bot, so a seasonal week needs
-- only one willing player.
--
-- SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE for every move (Filler/Miny model, not a replay): the
-- full board lives in rps_round_secrets, which has no client grants; the
-- client sees only the sanitized view rps-action returns. No parity contract.
--
-- Scoring (rps-action rpsScore): a win is 1000 + 60 per own fighter left + a
-- tempo bonus of max(0, 800 − 8 × your moves); a loss is 25 per enemy fighter
-- taken. Capped at 3000. Weekly ranking = best single match.
--
-- The free „Wszystkie Gry" mode writes arcade_scores directly from rps-action
-- as service role (like Filler), so arcade.sql needs NO change for this game.
--
-- Run after supabase/schema.sql and supabase/hero-items.sql.
-- After running this file:
--   • re-run supabase/season-award-gating.sql (rotation entry + the
--     2026-10-05 debut override) — without it the week is played and NOBODY
--     IS PAID;
--   • re-run supabase/last-active.sql so rps_scores stamps the Biuro rail;
--   • supabase functions deploy rps-action.
